<h2>
        Who are we?
</h2>
<p>
        We are a group of 8th grade students who are attending Brickell Academy for Advanced Academics and Arts at Old Donation School: that of which is part of the Virginia Beach School system. As part of our 8th grade curriculum, we have to partake in a project known as Capstone that focuses on environmental, economical, and social sustainability. Our group has chosen to write an app which improves a user's driving habits through competition.
