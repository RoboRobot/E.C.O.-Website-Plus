    <h2>What did we create?</h2>
    <p>Our team worked to produce a mobile application that is able to connect to a car in order to monitor many of its previously hidden functions. The application provides calculations for features such as miles per gallon (MPG), revolutions per minute (RPM), and engine coolant temperature. The app takes this information and calculates an “ECO” score which is dependent upon fuel economy and CO2 emissions.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>How did we accomplish this task?</h2>
    <p>Our team produced an application in order to combat the emission of harmful gases. The application informs the driver of the ways that they can drive with the environment in mind and improve their fuel efficiency. This is combined with the ability to see and compare to how other users are driving in order to make them drive more economically friendly. </p>

    <h2>
    How does the application function?
    </h2>
    <p>
    After plugging the hardware component into the car’s OBD2 port, the device sends its readings to your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy. This data is then sent from your phone to a server.  The server calculates your ECO score, sends it to a leaderboard, and can be viewed on your phone.

    <h2>
    How was the application intended to be used?
    </h2>
    <p>
    The application receives the car’s data that was previously unavailable before and shows this to the driver. The info is converted into an “ECO Score,” which is uploaded to a server that can be shown to other drivers, upon which will attempt to raise competition over who is the best driver. This competition is what is used to reduce the environmental impact created by cars.
    </p>

    <h2>
    What will be the impact?
    </h2>
    <p>
    If the app is used properly, the application will lower the amount of CO2 emissions and will improve fuel economy by encouraging the driver to improve their driving habits.  Only the “ECO Score” calculation will be shown to other users of the app in order to create competition. People have a natural instinct to compete amongst themselves. Therefore, the app will have people competing for a better score.
